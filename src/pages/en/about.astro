			I’m a web developer with extensive experience and a constant curiosity for technology. I’m passionate about creating useful solutions, exploring new tools, and learning something new every day. I enjoy clean code as much as meaningful conversations, and I value projects that combine logic, design, and purpose. Outside of work, I’m inspired by books, music, and simple moments with friends and pets.

			As a self-taught developer, I discovered in technology an endless field for learning and creation. Continuous learning has given me a multidisciplinary vision and a unique approach to problem-solving. Innovation not only inspires me—it defines how I work: always exploring new paths, challenging the status quo, and finding solutions from unconventional perspectives.

			Pimienta is my four-legged companion, a rescued street cat who became an essential part of my life. With her energy and affection, she fills my days with joy. I always strive to keep her happy—because in her own way, she takes care of me too.

			I deeply value my friends—few but unconditional—and I’m lucky to be surrounded by kind neighbors. My son is a constant source of love and motivation, and every day I try to do something, no matter how small, that contributes to my community’s well-being. I believe in the power of human connection and in the positive impact of everyday actions.

			I enjoy reading, playing video games, and exploring new technologies. I also find peace in hands-on activities: carpentry, metalwork, plumbing, electrical work—anything related to home maintenance. Restoring old furniture and tools not only relaxes me, but also connects me to the value of handmade things with history.

		<Item title="My Values" image="/assets/images/about/4902456906845631534.jpg">
			My worldview is rooted in humanistic and progressive nihilism. I believe that by accepting the absence of a predetermined purpose, we can create our own—based on collective well-being. I trust that the collaboration between humans and technology won’t just transform society, but will also unlock humanity’s most noble and benevolent potential.

		<Item title="What Inspires Me" image="/assets/images/about/4902456906845631536.jpg">
			When facing complex challenges, I often seek inspiration in nature and key moments of human history. I’m fascinated by how the sages and scientists of the past uncovered deep truths in the simplest things—even in a speck of dust. That ability to observe with humility and wonder is a constant guide in how I think and create.

		<Item title="A Fun Fact About Me" image="/assets/images/about/4902456906845631535.jpg">
			Although I’m a reserved person, I laugh and joke almost all the time. My way of connecting with others is always warm—no matter the first impression. I like to think that humor and kindness are shortcuts to more honest and meaningful communication.

			I’m always learning something new—usually from more than one field at a time. Right now, I’m passionate about the details of quantum physics, artificial intelligence, and the history of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. I firmly believe it’s never too late—or too early—to be fascinated by knowledge.

			My daily life flows between lines of code, fresh coffee, and background music. My workspace is simple but functional, designed to keep me focused and creative. I alternate between screen time and manual tools, depending on the project or the moment. Each day is a mix of structure and spontaneity—with space to learn, build, and improve.
